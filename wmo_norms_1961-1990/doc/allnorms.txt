     C.  NORMALS DATA FILE

     The WMO global normals data are archived by station sort
     (region number, country code, WMO station number, national
     identification number) then parameter (climatic element,
     statistic, qualifier code).

     Each data record consists of station identification
     information, data period, parameter information, normals
     data values, and quality assurance (QC) codes.

     Some Members provided monthly normal values but not annual
     normal values, some provided annual normal values but not
     monthly normal values, and some provided both monthly and
     annual normal values.  In some cases, the Member computed
     the annual normal value from the monthly normal values (but
     did not take into account rounding errors).  In other cases
     the Member computed the annual normal value from the
     sequential annual values over the normals period.  The
     annual values as provided by the Member are included in the
     normals data file.  Also included are annual values computed
     by the NCDC from the monthly values that were provided using
     a rigorous rounding methodology.

     The WMO Secretary-General, in Circular No. M/CLC, specified
     a list of requested parameters and desired (optional)
     parameters, and the requested units resolution for each
     parameter, which the WMO Members were asked to provide for
     the 1961-1990 global standard normals project.  The
     parameters and units resolution that were, in fact, provided
     varied from Member to Member.  Some Members submitted their
     data in units or to a resolution different from that
     requested.  Where necessary, the data were converted to the
     requested units before being added to the data base.

     A three-tiered parameter coding system was developed to
     accommodate the large variety of parameter descriptions that
     were submitted.  The climatic element-statistic-qualifier
     codes were assigned to the submitted parameters based on the
     Members' description of the parameters.  In some instances,
     the parameter description was very limited.  The parameter
     coding system used here consists of a climatic element code,
     a statistic code, and a qualifier code.  The climatic
     element and statistic codes are required for each record to
     describe the basic parameter submitted.  In some cases, a
     qualifier code is needed to further identify certain aspects
     of the element or statistic.  For example, qualifiers are
     used to specify temperature and precipitation threshold
     values (for mean number of days with), wind directions (for
     wind frequencies), measurement depth (for mean soil
     temperature), statistic (for number of years normals value
     based on), etc.

     The WMO distinguishes between provisional and standard
     normals.  Normals are computed from data over a 30-year
     period, defined by international agreement as three
     consecutive decades.  If there is too much missing data or
     the data are not adjusted for inhomogeneities, the computed
     normals are considered to be provisional.  A provisional
     normal is defined here as a normal that is based on an
     insufficient period of record (for any of the 12 months,
     either more than 5 years are missing, or 3 or more
     consecutive year-month values are missing, or both). 
     Otherwise, the normal is considered to be a standard normal. 
     The homogeneity question is addressed separately here by the
     specific standard/provisional normal and homogeneity
     indicator code used (see Table 5).  In many cases, the
     Member did not provide information on the homogeneity issue. 
     The user is referred to the standard/provisional normal and
     homogeneity indicator code and any narrative metadata
     provided by the Members for the available information that
     addresses the homogeneity issue.

     The normals data consist of decimal values, integer values
     (for some elements, and for year and year/date values), and
     special codes.  The special codes are defined as follows:

     CODE VALUE     DEFINITION

                    indicates no precipitation occurred in the
                    period of record at the station (Sudan)
            33      a value of 33 for the day of occurrence
                    indicates the daily extreme event occurred
                    several times
          1999      a value of 1999 for the year of occurrence
                    indicates the monthly extreme event occurred
                    several times
        199999      a value of 199999 for the year and day of
                    occurrence indicates the daily extreme event
                    occurred several times

Section 16.  DATA QUALITY:  Quality Statement

     Limited quality assurance (QC) procedures were applied to
     some parameters as a check of the data entry and keying
     process.  The QC consisted of four categories of tests:

     1.        Absolute limits checks (abbreviated "Abs" in the
               following tables).

     2.        Internal consistency checks between elements and
               statistics (abbreviated "Int" in the following
               tables).

     3.        Comparison of the 1961-1990 normals values
               submitted as part of this project to the
               corresponding 1971-1980 means which were part of
               the World Weather Records (WWR) (abbreviated "Com"
               in the following tables).

     4.        Internal consistency check between the annual
               value (where available) and the monthly values
               (abbreviated "Year" in the following tables).  The
               annual value was compared to the mean or sum of
               the monthly values, as appropriate.

     The first three categories of QC tests were performed on
     both the monthly and annual values.  The fourth category of
     tests was performed on only the annual values.  The specific
     tests that were performed in each category varied with
     category and depended on the elements and statistics
     submitted by the Member.

     Column 37 of the data record contains a code indicating
     which categories of tests were performed on the values in
     the record.  A code appears adjacent to each monthly and
     annual value which indicates the results of these tests for
     the value (this is the "test failure" QC code).  It should
     be noted that the test failure QC code indicates only if the
     data value failed a test; it does not indicate if the value
     is in error.  It is possible for a valid normals data value
     to fail a QC test if it is beyond the specified limits for
     the parameter or if the procedure utilized in the
     computation of the normals data value resulted in an
     apparent inconsistency.  (A few examples of this include: 
     high altitude stations may be windier than the extreme wind
     speed limit; some stations may have 1961-1990 normals which
     are considerably different from the 1971-1980 WWR means due
     to the variability of the parameter from decade to decade
     for those locations.)

     The set of tests performed on the data (indicated by the
     code in column 37) prescribes the range of possible test
     failure QC code values that each monthly/annual value on
     that record can have.  The column 37 code values are defined
     in Table 16A.  The monthly/annual test failure QC code
     values are defined in Table 16B.

     Table 16A.  QC code values for column 37, indicating which
     categories of tests were performed ("Y" indicates tests in
     this category were performed, "-" indicates tests in this
     category were not performed).  Also shown are the
     corresponding allowable test failure QC codes for the
     monthly/annual normals values.

     The specific tests that were applied in each category are
     discussed in Appendix A-2: QC Tests.

     Data entry and keying errors that were flagged by the QC
     tests were corrected.  For the remaining values that were
     flagged, the consistency of the differences or ratios among
     the 12 months was examined in a search for systematic
     differences.  Suspect data were examined manually and were
     adjusted if problem resolution (for example, digits
     transposed, missing negative sign, decimal point off, values
     not in requested units) were possible.  In some cases the
     contributing Member provided revised values.  After the
     adjustments and revisions were applied, the data were again
     subjected to the complete suite of QC tests.

23.  APPENDIX:  Appendix A-2: QC Tests

     This appendix describes the range of specific tests that
     were performed in each of the four QC test categories.  The

     B.  SPECIFIC INTERNAL CONSISTENCY CHECKS BETWEEN ELEMENTS
         AND STATISTICS.
     
     1.   Number of days with temperatures consistency check:
     
          (NDTmax >= Ti) greater than or equal to (NDTmax >= Ti+1)
          (NDTmax <= Ti) less than or equal to (NDTmax <= Ti+1)
          (NDTmin >= Ti) greater than or equal to (NDTmin >= Ti+1)
          (NDTmin <= Ti) less than or equal to (NDTmin <= Ti+1)
          (NDTmean >= Ti) greater than or equal to (NDTmean >=
               Ti+1)
          (NDTmean <= Ti) less than or equal to (NDTmean <= Ti+1)
          (NDTmax > Ti) greater than or equal to (NDTmax > Ti+1)
          (NDTmax < Ti) less than or equal to (NDTmax < Ti+1)
          (NDTmin > Ti) greater than or equal to (NDTmin > Ti+1)
          (NDTmin < Ti) less than or equal to (NDTmin < Ti+1)
     
           where
     
           NDTmax = number of days with maximum temperature,
           NDTmin = number of days with minimum temperature,
           NDTmean = number of days with mean temperature,
           Ti = a temperature threshold value,
           Ti+1 = a temperature threshold value > Ti.
     
     2.    Number of days with precipitation consistency check:
     
       (NDPrecip >= Xi) greater than or equal to (NDPrecip >=
            Xi+1)
       (NDRain >= Xi) greater than or equal to (NDRain >= Xi+1)
       (NDSF >= Xi) greater than or equal to (NDSF >= Xi+1)
       (NDSC >= Xi) greater than or equal to (NDSC >= Xi+1)
     
       where     NDPrecip = number of days with precipitation,
                 NDRain = number of days with rain,
                 NDSF = number of days with snowfall,
                 NDSC = number of days with snow cover,
                 Xi  = a precipitation, rainfall, snowfall, or
                       snow cover threshold value,
                 Xi+1 = a precipitation, rainfall, snowfall, or
                        snow cover threshold value > Xi.
     
     3.    Temperature consistency check:
     
       For a given temperature element,
     
       (lowest {minimum} value) less than or equal to (mean
            value)
       (mean value) less than or equal to (highest {maximum}
            value)
     
     4.    Cross-element temperature consistency check:
     
       (extreme {coldest} minimum temperature) less than
                 (normal {average} minimum temperature)
       (normal {average} minimum temperature) less than
                 (normal {average} mean temperature)
       (normal {average} mean temperature) less than
                 (normal {average} maximum temperature)
       (normal {average} maximum temperature) less than
                 (extreme {warmest} maximum temperature)
     
     5.    Precipitation quintiles consistency check:
     
       0 <= Min <= Q1 <= Q2 <= Q3 <= Q4 <= Max
     
       where
     
           Min = smallest monthly precipitation value,
           Q1 = first (20%) monthly precipitation quintile,
           Q2 = second (40%) monthly precipitation quintile,
           Q3 = third (60%) monthly precipitation quintile,
           Q4 = fourth (80%) monthly precipitation quintile,
           Max = largest monthly precipitation value.
     
     6.    Atmospheric pressure consistency check:
     
       (mean sea level pressure) greater than or equal to
                 (mean station pressure)
     
       Note:  If a station's elevation is below sea level,
              then the station should be expected to fail this
              consistency check.
     
     7.    Monthly amount/number of days consistency check:
     
       If Precip = 0, then NDPrecip should = 0.
       If NDPrecip = 0, then Precip should = 0.
       If SF = 0, then NDSF should = 0.
       If NDSF = 0, then SF should = 0.
     
       where     Precip = total monthly precipitation amount,
                 SF = total monthly snowfall amount,
                 NDPrecip = number of days with precipitation,
                 NDSF = number of days with snowfall.
     
     8.    Precipitation amount consistency check:
     
       Psmall <= (normal total precipitation) <= Plarge
     
       where     Psmall = smallest monthly precipitation amount,
                 Plarge = largest monthly precipitation amount.
     
     
     C.  SPECIFIC ELEMENTS COMPARED TO THE WORLD WEATHER RECORDS
         (WWR) 1971-1980 MEANS.
     
     The 1961-1990 normals were compared to the WWR 1971-1980
     means for those stations and elements that were available in
     both data sets.  Two types of comparisons were made:
     
     1.    For mean temperature, station pressure, and sea level
           pressure, differences between the 1961-1990 normals and
           their corresponding WWR means were computed for all 12
           months and the annual value.  If the difference was
           greater than a specified threshold (a threshold was
           chosen to account for the fact that a 30-year mean was
           being compared to a 10-year mean), the value was
           flagged as failing the test.  The magnitude of the
           thresholds were:
     
           mean temperature    2.0 oC
           station pressure    3.0 hPa
           sea level pressure  3.0 hPa
     
     2.    For monthly and annual total precipitation amount, the
           ratio between the 1971-1980 WWR means and the 1961-1990
           normals was computed.  If the ratio was significantly
           different from 1.0 (i.e., outside the range 0.6 to
           1.4), the value was flagged as failing the test.  (A
           range was chosen to account for the fact that a 30-year
           mean was being compared to a 10-year mean.)  The
           following specific patterns were also checked for:  (i)
           the ratio was approximately 10.0 or 0.1 (indicating a
           decimal placement error); (ii) the ratio was
           approximately 25.4 (indicating an English-Metric units
           difference); and (iii) the ratio was approximately 2.54
           (indicating a combination of i and ii).  For these
           three pattern checks, the value was flagged as failing
           the test if the ratio fell within a specified range. 
           The ranges for these pattern tests were determined by
           manually examining a subset of the data and consisted
           of:
     
           (i) decimal placement error         0.07 - 0.13 and
                                               7.0  - 13.0
           (ii) English-Metric units error     18.0 - 30.0
           (iii) combination (i) and (ii)      1.8  - 3.00
     
       Precipitation values near 0.0 result in unreliable or
       unrepresentative ratios.  Consequently, no
       precipitation comparison was made if both the 10-year
       and 30-year means were less than or equal to 5.0 mm.
     
     
     D.  INTERNAL CONSISTENCY CHECK BETWEEN THE ANNUAL VALUE AND
         THE MONTHLY VALUES.
     
     The annual value provided by the Member (designated here as
     ANNMEM) was compared to the annual value computed by the
     NCDC from the monthly values provided by the Member
     (designated here as ANNCOMP).  If the two annual values
     differed by an amount greater than 0.05, then the ANNMEM
     value was flagged as failing this test.  Both annual values
     were saved in the digital data base.
     
     Differences between ANNMEM and ANNCOMP could result from
     differences in rounding methodologies or differences in how
     the annual value was computed (i.e., an annual normal
     computed from the monthly normal values versus an annual
     normal computed by averaging the individual annual values
     from each year of the normals period).  A value for ANNCOMP
     was computed only if all 12 months were non-missing and were
     not a trace value.  The ANNCOMP value is the sum of the
     monthly normal values for the following elements:
     
       total precipitation amount
       snowfall amount
       sunshine duration
       evaporation
       total rainfall amount
       number of days
     
     The ANNCOMP value is the average of the monthly normal
     values for the following elements:
     
       temperature
       relative humidity
       atmospheric pressure
       vapor pressure
       wind speed
       sky (cloud) cover
